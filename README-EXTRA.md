# Extra Setup Notes

## Terminal

SIMBL is a .pkg file and needs to be manually installed.  [Download](http://www.culater.net/dl/files/SIMBL-0.9.9.zip)

After installing, need to toggle "Open in 32-bit mode" in the properties dialog for the Terminal app.

Restoring terminal settings will remap the home/end keys to the more natural setting.

## Mac App Store

Several applications are installed through the Mac App Store.  Open it up, sign in, and reinstall all purchased apps there.
